# VisitMK - Tourism Website Prototype

VisitMK is a high-fidelity prototype of a tourism platform designed for visitors to Milton Keynes. This prototype was developed for the CO2104: User Interface Design and Evaluation coursework at the University of Leicester.

## Project Overview

The goal of VisitMK is to offer a user-friendly interface that enables users to:

- Browse events in Milton Keynes
- Book tickets (with optional card payment simulation)
- Generate personalised tour plans based on preferences
- Navigate easily across devices with a fully responsive layout

The prototype was built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of external frameworks.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and password reset functionality (simulated)
- **Event Booking**: Book free or paid events (card field appears conditionally)
- **Hover-Based Event Details**: Additional event info shown on hover, including map and ratings
- **Plan My Tour Generator**: Custom itinerary generation based on user inputs
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes; preference saved in local storage
- **Responsive Carousel**: Homepage image carousel with dot navigation
- **Form Validation**: Built-in JavaScript validation for all forms

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
